# College of Manifestation

A Bardic subclass built around interacting with multiple realities and affecting unseen forces.  

You learn the blink spell when you gain access to level 3 spells.  

## Level 3  
  
### Mime Performance  
As a free action, for a minute you can interact with objects in other worlds.  

If you not immobilized, you can do some parkour shit. You can climb walls, go up and down stairs, stand up on barrels, etc... Your movement speed is increased by 10 ft., and once per turn you can perform **one** of the following special movements:

- **Ladder**: Once per turn and while your hands are free (stowing a weapon is also free) you can move straight up using your movement. If you finish your movement in the air, you fall. If your ladder "leans" on a wall, you may perform an athletics or acrobatics check to hold on to it (if possible!)

- **Stairs**: You can move in diagonal lines up, and up to half your movement (but only uses half your movement). If you finish your movement in the air, you fall. If you finish within 5 feet of solid surface (this includes finishing at a wall whose edge is 5 ft above you), you may perform an athletics or acrobatics check to jump across/ hold on to it. If you finish next to a wall, you may attempt an athletics/acrobatics check to hold on to it. If you finish 5 ft from a wall, you may attempt a harder DC check to jump and hold on to it.

- **Bridge**: Once per turn, you can move across a gap of length up to half your movement (but only uses half your movement).

In addition, you can perform these once per turn:
- **Pedestal**: As a bonus action, you can elevate yourself by up to 10 ft.
  
- **Mocking Miming**: as a bonus action, perform an offensive mimicry  of a single creature within 60 ft. of you. The creature must have an intelligence score of at least 8 to understand they need to be insulted.
  The next concentration saving throw or wisdom/intelligence/charisma ability check is made with disadvantage. If used outside of combat will not be perceived as an assault, but might be a bit hostile.


You can do this a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus** after a **short rests**.
You can also spend bardic inspiration dice for this feature.

### Un-Banish  

Using your action, you can bring forth objects from other realities:

- Summon a simple non-magical weapon.

- An item of GP value no more than your bard level.

- A ladder / rope up to 10/30 ft of length (rope requires athletics check to climb)

- A pool with enough liquid for 2 people to fill their water skins. When used, the DM rolls on a secret table to determine what the liquid actually is (most of the time its water of low quality).

The item stays in your realm for 10 minutes (the liquid is permanent once removed from the pool). 

You can also spend bardic inspiration dice for this feature, in which case these options are empowered and items last for an hour. You may spend spell slots to extend the duration by a number of hours equal to the slot's level:

- Summon a magical(+0 at level 3, +1 at level 7, +2 at level 11 and +3 at level 15) weapon set (sword and shield, couple of daggers).

- Summon a rough set of ethereal tools (thieves tools, chef's tools, etc...). Rolls made with these tools have disadvantage. (disadvantage is removed at level 11)

- An item of GP value no more than 5 times your bard level. Can be used to summon non-consumable spell components (within reason).

- A ladder / rope up to 10/30 ft of length (rope requires athletics check to climb)

- A pool with enough liquid for 5 people to fill their water skins. When used, the DM rolls on a secret table to determine what the liquid actually is (most of the time its water of high quality).

## Level 6  
### Otherworldly Performance  

You channel the aspect of a universe you are interacting with into the material plane.  

You can use a bonus action spend and roll a bardic inspiration die(BIR is the result) to create one of the following effects:

- Create a straight platform made of a number of 5x5 feet squares/hexes equal to your BIR+1, of the same height and orientation, lasting for 1d4 turns(can be used to create a wall). A platform has AC of 8 and vanishes if it takes 5+ damage in a single hit. Huge and larger creatures can attempt an athletics check against DC 10 to burst through them using a bonus action(instead of attacking multiple platforms individually/via AOE).

THIS NEEDS BUFFING!
- Ethereal Entanglement - Once per turn, targeting a single creature up to large size within 30 ft of you, you can summon ethereal vines, small rocks or any other stumbling object that appears briefly near its legs. Its speed is reduced by 10 ft and it must make an acrobatics check or stumble and be restrained until the start of its next turn. This can be used as a bonus action, triggering the effect the next time until the start of your next turn the target moves, or as reaction to a creature's movement.

- Glass - For one minute, the environment around you fractures like a mirror.
  Your body becomes prismatic and refractive. Attackers have disadvantage on the first attack they make against you each turn. When you are hit by an attack, shards of illusory glass explode outward, dealing psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker.

Instead you can use an action to spend and roll your bardic inspiration die and expend a spell slot of level 2 or higher to enact one of the following changes to the original version, after which roll on the **aspect table**.

- Create a straight platform made of a number of 5x5 feet squares/hexes equal to BIR+spell level+1, of the same height and orientation, lasting for 2d4 turns(can be used to create a wall). A platform has an AC of 10+spell level and vanishes if it takes 10 + spell levelX2 damage in a single hit. Huge and larger creatures can attempt an athletics check against DC 10 + spell level to burst through them using a bonus action(instead of attacking multiple platforms individually/via AOE).
  
- Ethereal Entanglement - Once per turn, targeting a single creature up to huge size within 60 ft of you, you can summon ethereal vines, small rocks or any other stumbling object that appears briefly near its legs. Its speed is reduced by 10 ft and it must make an acrobatics check or stumble and be restrained until the start of its next turn. This can be used as a bonus action, triggering the effect the next time until the start of your next turn the target moves, or as reaction to a creature's movement.
  In addition, the creature takes BIR+spell level+charisma bonus piercing damage.

- Glass - For one minute, the environment around you fractures like a mirror.
  Your body becomes prismatic and refractive. Attackers have disadvantage on the first attack they make against you each turn. When you are hit by an attack, shards of illusory glass explode outward, dealing psychic damage equal to a roll of your bardic inspiration die to the attacker + proficiency bonus. In addition, whenever you make an attack or cast a cantrip, shards of parallel realities around you reflect your action dealing additional damage equal to a roll of your bardic inspiration die.


After a using a spell slot to empower an Otherworldly Performance, or when pulling off a really cool turn with the Mime Performance or Un-banish features, roll on the universe table to see which universe will be channeled. 

Only one effect can be active at a time, they all last until the start of your next turn unless stated otherwise or they include regaining HP or inspiration dice, and resistances are applied only to the next instance of damage of that type.
