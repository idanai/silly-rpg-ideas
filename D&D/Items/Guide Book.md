Rarity: Artefact
## Description
Bound in old leather, are 200 old pages. On the front cover, etched in thin silver, is the title: "Here & There: an Adventurer's Guide Book".
The book is a window to another (simulated?) reality, almost identical to our own, where a sentient character- drawn expertly in black ink- by the name of Sammy (or any other name, race and gender; according to the GM) lives. Sammy is a kindred spirit, who loves travel and good conversation. Sammy is alone in his realm, and loves when people open the book to converse with him, or seek his advice.
Sammy acts as if he is there with the players, and gets confused when asked about the nature of the book and his existence, not answering in any useful way.

## Quest
Sammy is looking for his companions: his best friend and his lost love. They were scattered once after an accident, and never saw each other again. Sammy does not know of their whereabouts, if they are even alive, but does not let it discourage him.
The GM may leave clues in the form of pages with drawings on them, scattered around the world, as to the whereabouts of the next clues, eventually leading to the best-friend & the lost love.
Each clue is a riddle, describing an item owned by the companions or Sammy. When the players realise which item is described, the words are replaced by a colourful drawing of the item, the page immediately binds itself to the book, and Sammy receives the item, which retains it's colour.
When each clue is bound to the book, the bonuses granted by the book increase by one.
When all the clues are gathered, and the quest is complete, Sammy & the players find out that the best friend and the lost love found each other eventually and looked for Sammy. Along the way they assumed he died, gave up on looking for him, fell in love with each other and settled down somewhere.
When Sammy finds out, the players are sucked into the book with their equipment where they witness Sammy morph into a Huge monster of Ink, with a killing intent aimed towards his old companions. They can choose to fight him, or try to convince him to calm.
1. If Sammy is killed by the players... #TODO
2. If the lost companions are killed, Sammy morphs back into his old self, starts weeping and... #TODO
3. If Sammy is calmed down by the players, he is accepted back by his companions. The three of them find a solution, where the lost love loves both Sammy and his best friend.
If the players try to leave the Book's dimension, they only appear in the expected parallel of their destination in drawn form, so that they are still in the book. To leave the book, the scene must be resolved.
Resolving the scene grants the players an Artefact #TODO and the book becomes a written and illustrated depiction of Sammy's adventures with the party, as if he were really there with them the whole time. The book also contains descriptions of people's emotions and thoughts, from a narrator's perspective, revealing lies and feelings unknown to the players of people the met.
#Alternative The book itself becomes the artefact.

## Attunement
The book requires attunement to receive the bonuses and to task Sammy, but not to converse with him.

## Actions
##### Helpful Guide
Anyone carrying the book, can use an action to open the book and talk to Sammy, seeking his advice. This grants an accumulating bonus (increases as the players find clues), which starts at +1 to the following:
1. Wisdom (Survival) checks in order to find their way in the wild
2. Intelligence (Nature) checks to look for natural supplies in the wild
3. Intelligence (Investigation) checks to find treasure, hidden doors, and traps
However, taking this action grants Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, or Advantage on foes' Wisdom (Perception) checks for the immediate scene (GM's discretion).
##### A favour for a favour
The player holding the book may ask Sammy for their assistance in looking for an object, or to map an area no larger than #TODO. If the task is considered trespassing, illegal, or will assist in theft, the player must succeed on a Charisma (Persuasion) with a high DC or Charisma (Deception) with a lower DC (because Sammy is trusting) to convince him to to the task. If the Persuasion check is failed, Sammy kindly refuses to take on the task. If the Deception check is failed, Sammy will refuse any following favours and the bonuses granted by the book will be lost, until the players find a clue, after which Sammy will forgive them and bonuses return.
It could take Sammy as little as an hour to complete the task if the area is small, or as much as a day if the area is large. Alternatively, paper and ink of high quality, worth 50 Gold Pieces per hour, which can be used by a wizard for learning spells, can be fed to the book, allowing the players to browse further in the book into the Sammy's future, after he completed the task.
After completing the task, the players must find another clue before asking for another favour, or roll with a higher DC the same checks to ask for another favour.
