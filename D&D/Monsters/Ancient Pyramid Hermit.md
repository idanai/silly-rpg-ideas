Far away in the desert, or deep in the jungles, where ancient civilisations worshipped forgotten gods of violence and sanguine intent,  lay- dormant- underneath their grandiose shrines of architecturally sound: pyramids, ziggurats, stupas, and mounds; titanic abominations rest in the shade of their titanic crust of stone.

The reason for their existence is assumed to be related to some ancient war, or gift from gods as means of protection.

The Ancient Pyramid Hermits are gargantuan crustations that dorm underneath massive constructs. It is unknown whether the pyramids are connected to the Hermit itself, or were built around them.
